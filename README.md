backbone-twitter-demo
=====================

[Demo](http://version2beta.com/media/examples/backbone-twidget/ "Backbone-twidget demo")

A simple demonstration of Backbone.js' collections and views. This widget searches Twitter for a given phrase and puts it in an element on the page. If the element is scrollable, it will do "infinite scrolling" - load more when you scroll to the bottom of the list.

I like this approach better than the standard Twitter widget that shows a user's stream. Using this widget with a search for the user will display conversations with and about the user. The same applies to a company, a product, a project, a package, an event - the widget shows people talking about your stuff, not you talking.

To Do:

*	Localize (localise?) the tweet times. Should show the timestamp in local time.
*	Find links in tweets, and make them anchors.
*	Link avatars, names, and at-mentions to the twitter account
*	Link hashes to searches - but where, on twitter or in the twidget?
